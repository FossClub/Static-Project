<b><i><h1 style="color:orange;"> Summer Wedges</h1></b></i>
<img src="wedgeS1.jpg"  style="float:left; width="220"; height="220";hspace="20"">
<i>
<p style="color:pink;">Summer is all about dresses, short shorts, tank tops and pedicures.
Wedge boots, wedgies, or lifties are shoes and boots with a sole in the form of a wedge, 
such that one piece of material, normally rubber, serves as both the sole and the heel. 
This design dates back to ancient Greece.Wedgies for women are more common and often have a sole that is much 
thicker at the back than at the front, making them high-heeled boots or shoes. 
Wedgies for women were popularized by Salvatore Ferragamo, who introduced the design to the Italian market 
in the late 1930s.Some forms of wedge boots, called platform boots, have thick soles throughout.

<b><i><h1 style="color:orange;"> Riding Boots</h1></b></i>
<img src="ridingS2.jpg"  style="float:left; width="220"; height="220";hspace="20"">
<i>
<p style="color:pink;">A riding boot is a boot made to be used for horse riding.
 The classic boot comes high enough up the leg to prevent the leathers of the saddle from 
pinching the leg of the rider, has a sturdy toe to protect the rider's foot when on the ground 
and has a distinct heel to prevent the foot from sliding through the stirrup.
 The sole is smooth or lightly textured to avoid being caught on the tread of the stirrup in the event of a fall.
The modern riding boot is relatively low-heeled, with a heel of less than one inch, 
though historically a higher heel was common, as it has always been critically important for riding boots 
to prevent the foot from slipping through the stirrup. Today, only some styles of cowboy boot retain a higher
 heel than other modern riding boots.

<b><i><h1 style="color:orange;">Classic Pumps</h1></b></i>
<img src="classicS8.jpg"  style="float:left; width="320"; height="320";hspace="20"">
<i>
<p style="color:pink;">Pumps for women are usually heeled. The shape has varied through time. In the UK, in 2007,
 a closed toe and wide (non-stiletto) heel were worn by the very fashion-conscious, but most still wore stilettos
 of mainly 'kitten' height to medium height.In the UK, outside the fashion trade, the term "pumps" would normally imply flat or low-heel dancing or ballerina pumps, or even rubber-soled canvas plimsolls. In the U.S.,
 "pumps" exclusively refers to women's shoes with a kitten or higher heel.Pumps can be made from any material, but traditional patent leather is popular.
 Pumps are mostly worn with a suit or a uniform, but are also worn with formal and informal dresses, 
skirts, trousers, and jeans. White, stiletto-heeled pumps are the standard attire with swimsuits in beauty pageants.
Pumps are also part of the costume of a ballroom dancer. They are made of satin, usually tan, 
though other colors are made as well, and worn on both the competition and practice floors.</p>

<b><i><h1 style="color:orange;">Ballet Flats</h1></b></i>
<img src="BalletS3.jpg"  style="float:left; width="320"; height="320";hspace="20"">
<i>
<p style="color:pink;">Ballet flats or Dolly shoes are derived from a woman's soft ballet shoe, 
with a very thin heel or the appearance of no heel at all. The style sometimes features a ribbon-like
 binding around the low tops of the slipper and may have a slight gathering at the top-front of the vamp (toe box) 
and a tiny, decorative string tie. Ballet slippers can be adjusted and tightened to the wearer's foot by means
 of this string tie and done.The essence of the ballet flat has existed since at least the 16th century, in which men wore a similar shoe,
 then known as pompes. In medieval times ballet flats were popular with both men and women. They only came
 out of fashion in the 17th and 18th centuries when the high-heeled shoe came into fashion after Catherine
 de' Medici requested that her cobbler add 5 cm (2 inches) to her wedding shoes. Heels went out of fashion 
quickly after Marie Antoinette walked to the guillotine in a pair of heels. Functional shoes: sandals, boots,
 and flat shoes prevailed in the 19th century. Ballet flats took off again when Audrey Hepburn wore them with 
skinny jeans in Funny Face in 1957.More recently,variations of ballet flats have returned as a current fashion trend, often referred to as ballet pumps or ballet sneakers and designed for outdoor wear, using a variety of fabrics and usually with a rubber sole.</p>

<b><i><h1 style="color:orange;">Oxford Shoes</h1></b></i>
<img src="oxfordS4.jpg"  style="float:left; width="320"; height="320";hspace="20"">
<i>
<p style="color:pink;">Women’s oxford shoes are trending in the world of fashion; however, this trend 
dates back to the early nineteenth century. Borrowed from men’s footwear style, women’s oxfords have received
 immense popularity since the 1920s including much attention in the 1940s-1950. The body of the oxford shoe is 
created to appear as a flawless portion of leather, with a second leather piece forming the toe-cap. 
The differences in styles are generally due to the ornamentation: taller heels and designer colours.
 Since the current women’s oxfords draw ideas not only from the men’s shoe, but also from almost any conceivable
 source, the women’s variety has more freedom in terms of design, choice, and less adherence to tradition.
 This implies that Oxford shoes can fit almost every woman’s preferred style.</p>
